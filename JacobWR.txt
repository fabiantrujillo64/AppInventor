My partner and I created an app called can attack. The purpose of the game is to shoot the bad cans, if you shoot one of the good cans you’ll lose the game and would have to start over. The process of making a game varies from the amount of experience you have. My partner and I are still getting to know how some of the game mechanics work so we ran into an error involving the placements of the image sprites. Every time after the phone would turn on after shutting down on the app, the image sprites would shift to the left, messing up the x positioning of the sprites. So we had to come up with an equation that would keep the images at a default position once the app is started up after being locked. Once we had figured out an equation to keep the sprites in one spot we had put the code into a procedure and put it in a timer block, the timer block is active as long as someone is playing the game so it made it convenient for us to put the x positioning code in the timer block. Now the blocks go back to where they belong even after the phone or tablet has been locked.
