I will be showing you an app that I helped make, it’s called can attack. When the app starts you can see the brading screen for a couple seconds and then it cuts to the main menu. When you press the play button the game starts, you can really win other than set a high score. When you press the about button it tells you how to play the game, when you shoot the good cans you will lose the game and when you shoot the bad cans, you will again a point. So now you can go back and press play, there will be three cans on your screen. They will cycle through all varieties of cans and if you press the bad cans you will see you score on the top left corner of the screen, there’s really no limit so you could possibly challenge your friends and tell them to beat your score if you record it somewhere. On the top right of the screen there is a pause button that gives you two options, to resume of go back to the main menu. Once you press a good can you will get a game over and be given two options, restart or go back to the main menu. If you press on the main menu you will get a notifier asking if you are sure. If you press on the restart button it will restart and play normally. Once you are finished with your playing session you can quit any time you’d like, just press the pause button or tap on a good can to get a game over and you can choose the main menu option and then you are done playing.
